# Tune List
Tune List is cross platform mobile app for recording keyboard-based music snippets and adding them to an in-app playlist. It was built using React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and JSX (HTML based JavaScript). It utilizes local file storage for audio recording and saving, and doubly-linked list for ordered playback.
